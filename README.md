# Tic-Tac-Toe-playing-robot-with-PIC
This is a simple project to build a robot that can play tic-tac-toe game strategically with a human player. In the programming aspect, the base of this robot is PIC programming using a PIC development board (see the report). Also it is equally important to have a well designed hardware implementation.
At firts, we segmented the whole project into few segments. Namely, 
  1. Actuators designing
  2. Stencil designing
  3. Stratergic algorithm construction
  4. Programming
The harder part in this project is to programm the PIC micro-controller according to the stratergic algorithm that we have constructed. At firts we tried to implement a unbeatale algorithm. But due to memory and computing limitations in the PIC micro-controller we had to change the approach. However, we were able to construct and programm a algorithm with a robot winning probability over 65%.
