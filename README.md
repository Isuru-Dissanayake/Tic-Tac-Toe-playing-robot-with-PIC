# Tic-Tac-Toe-playing-robot-with-PIC
This is a simple project to build a robot that can play tic-tac-toe game strategically with a human player. In the programming aspect, the base of this robot is PIC programming using a PIC development board (see the report). Also it is equally important to have a well designed hardware implementation.
